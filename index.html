        <h3>A few things about me!</h3>
        <p>I am a freshman here at BYUi. I grew up in the oven known as Gilbert, Arizona. Yes, it is a dry heat but 120° is 120°!</p>
        <p class="background">I speak Mandarin Chinese and am working on my minor in it. I love singing and music in general and really anything active especially tennis.</p>
        <p>I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the Northeast coast of England and Rochester, Minnesota.</p>
        <p class="background">I'm trying to learn about web design because a lot of my family wished they lived in 1800's and I want to be able to help them in future as technology contiues to grow.</p>
